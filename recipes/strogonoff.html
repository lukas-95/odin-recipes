     <h2><p><strong>How to make</strong></p>
    
        <p><strong>First</strong></p>

      <p>In a large skillet brown your meat in oil over medium-high heat. 
          When meat is browned <em>(a little croast)</em>, drain excess fat from skillet.
          Reserve the meat in a bowl. Pay attention, too much meat on your skillet won't deliver an amazing croast.
          When you finish your last round of meat, add onion <em>(in cubes)</em>, 
          garlic <em>(I prefer the slightest slices)</em>, salt and pepper and stir in.</p>

          <p><strong>Second</strong></p>

       <p>Add mushrooms, bell pepper <em>(yellow, red, green)</em>, 3 sp of mayo, 1 sp of ketchup/barbecue 
          1/2 sp of mustard.
          Remove from heat, add sour cream, the amount depends on how creamy you want. 
          Stir everything, serve with chips and withe rice</p>
